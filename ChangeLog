	* mclistbox.tcl: Added editcombo function, same as edit function but uses
	a combo box.
	Fixed bug in bbox.
	Fixed yscrollcommand handling to get *all* the updates.
	Fixed some formatting bugs.

1999-10-28  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* mclistbox.tcl: Added -editable/-editcommand for columns and 
	-iseditableindexcommand for the listbox.  The first two control the 
	placement and function of an "Edit" button for the specified column --
	if editable is true, the button is there.  When clicked, it calls 
	-editcommand with the name of the megawidget, the column name and the
	currently selected index.

	The third allows the user to specify a function that will return 1 or 0,
	indicating whether the selected index (or indices) are editable.  If
	they are, then the Edit buttons are enabled; if not, they are disabled.
	If not iseditableindexcommand is set, then the buttons are enabled 
	anytime there is just one item selected (ie, no multi-selections allowed).

	* mclistbox.tcl: Fixed a small bug with drag&drop and the insertion frame.
	The _over_drag_frame_cmd and _drop_drag_frame_cmd functions are brittle in
	the sense that they are dependant on the way that the widgets in the 
	megawidget are created.  Be sure to watch for that in the future.

1999-10-15  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* mclistbox.tcl: Added a flag "hidden" to NewColumn (defaults to false),
	which controls if the column will be a hidden column or not.  Hidden cols
	are children of the frame, non-hidden ones are children of the text widget.
	This makes clipping work correctly for the non-hidden columns (ie, they
	no longer run over the border).  This is kind of a kludgy way to do it,
	but it's safer than introducing another widget (which would be the 
	"correct" way to do it -- put an enclosing frame on the widget, and
	use that to show the border, etc).

1999-10-15  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* mclistbox.tcl: Added widgetDefault values for drag/drop options;
	extended edit command to allow the specification of a validate
	command, for validating the input before withdrawing the widgets;
	added tests of dropenabled/dragenabled in NewColumn, to only
	register the widget as a drag/drop site if it is enabled.

1999-10-14  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* mclistbox.tcl: Extended drag-and-drop support with a -dropcursor
	option; this lets the user specify what kind of insertion cursor
	will be shown when performing a drop into a listbox.  It can be
	one of before (shows a line before the dropindex), after (line
	after the dropindex), on (highlights the dropindex) or none (does
	nothing).
	Fixed a particularly bad bug in Configure:  there were several
	comments inappropriately placed in a switch statement that were
	preventing it from ever executing.  It's a wonder that the listbox
	worked at all.
	Added some code to remove the insertion bar when leaving the widget 
	during dragover.
	Added an edit function, for doing inline edits.

	* mclistbox.tcl: Added support for BWidget drag-and-drop protocol.
	Added a drag_end command.
