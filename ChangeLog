	* mclistbox.tcl: Extended drag-and-drop support with a -dropcursor
	option; this lets the user specify what kind of insertion cursor
	will be shown when performing a drop into a listbox.  It can be
	one of before (shows a line before the dropindex), after (line
	after the dropindex), on (highlights the dropindex) or none (does
	nothing).
	Fixed a particularly bad bug in Configure:  there were several
	comments inappropriately placed in a switch statement that were
	preventing it from ever executing.  It's a wonder that the listbox
	worked at all.
	Added some code to remove the insertion bar when leaving the widget 
	during dragover.
	Added an edit function, for doing inline edits.
